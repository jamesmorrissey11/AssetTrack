# AssetTrack (Contoso Industries)

AssetTrack is Contoso Industries' internal application for tracking hardware assets (laptops, monitors, phones, badges, docking stations) and the employees they're assigned to. It is intentionally built as a **polyglot microservices** application so that course learners can practice agentic, Copilot-driven development across a realistic multi-language stack — including a couple of older Java services that still need modernization.

All services talk over **REST/JSON**. Most backend services own a local SQLite database; `web` is stateless, and `reporting-svc` reads live data from other services instead of owning a primary database.

## Quick start (Codespaces or local devcontainer)

1. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces, or in VS Code with the Dev Containers extension.
2. Wait for the devcontainer to finish provisioning. It installs:
   - Node 22, .NET 10, Python 3.12, Maven, and **Java 21** (the JDK for all three JVM services; the two currency-lagging services target Java 17 bytecode and build fine on JDK 21).
   - `concurrently` and editable Python installs for the FastAPI services (via `postCreateCommand`).
3. From the workspace root:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts all seven services as plain processes (no Docker required). A startup banner prints the URL. Run `npm run dev:verbose` if you need full log output instead of WARN-only.

4. Open http://localhost:4321 — that's the UI. Backend services listen on 5001–5006 if you want to hit them directly with `curl`.

## Quick start (local without a devcontainer)

You need Node 22, .NET 10, Python 3.12, Maven, **and Java 21** on your machine. Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run install:all
npm run dev
```

## Running with Docker (optional)

A `docker-compose.yml` is still provided as an alternative to the dockerless workflow:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:4321.

## Repository tour

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for a structured repo tour: purpose, modules, entry points, data layers, scripts, and known gaps for each stack.

Each service folder also has its own `README.md` with native (non-Docker) run instructions and per-service scripts. See:

- [`services/web/README.md`](services/web/README.md)
- [`services/assets-svc/README.md`](services/assets-svc/README.md)
- [`services/workforce-svc/README.md`](services/workforce-svc/README.md)
- [`services/reporting-svc/README.md`](services/reporting-svc/README.md)
- [`services/notifications-svc/README.md`](services/notifications-svc/README.md)
- [`services/audit-svc/README.md`](services/audit-svc/README.md)
- [`services/auth-svc/README.md`](services/auth-svc/README.md)

## Auth

`auth-svc` issues RS256 JWTs from `POST /token`. Other services validate tokens via the JWKs document at `http://auth-svc:8080/.well-known/jwks`.

For course exercises that aren't about auth, the frontend runs with `DEV_TOKEN_MODE=true`, which uses a pre-issued long-lived token so learners aren't blocked by login flows. To exercise the real flow, set it to `false`.

## What's intentionally broken or missing

This is a teaching codebase. Several services have deliberate gaps that drive the course exercises (see [`exercises.md`](exercises.md)). For example:

- The two legacy Java services use raw JDBC string concatenation and have SQL injection.
- `reporting-svc` has old-style Python helpers and an import endpoint that crashes on bad rows.
- `assets-svc` accepts unvalidated input on create.
- The dashboard renders some status badges with the wrong colors.
- `workforce-svc` does not yet POST to `audit-svc` on assignment changes.

See [`exercises.md`](exercises.md) for the full exercise list.

## Course exercises

See [`exercises.md`](exercises.md). Each exercise is **atomic** — completing one is not a prerequisite for another. Exercises cover all five stacks (Astro, .NET, modern Java, Python, legacy Java) so learners can pick what's most useful to them.
