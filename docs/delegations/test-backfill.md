# Test Suite Backfill Delegation Brief

**PR Title:** Add test suite backfill

## Context

AssetTrack has minimal test coverage. A Playwright accessibility suite was started in `tests/playwright/` with role-based locators. The assets service (`services/assets-svc`) has an xUnit test project with only smoke tests. The reporting service (`services/reporting-svc`) has pytest configured but no actual tests written.

## Primary Goal: Expand Playwright Accessibility Coverage

Expand the Playwright test suite under `tests/playwright/` to cover:

- **Dashboard interactions:** Navigation between sections, link focus order, heading hierarchy
- **Navigation patterns:** Active states persist correctly, keyboard shortcuts (if any), breadcrumb navigation (if present)
- **Asset list filters:** Type and Status dropdowns are keyboard-navigable, search input works with keyboard, filter button is reachable and activatable, Clear link (when filters active) is accessible
- **Asset form behaviors:** Required field validation (if enforced), form submission success and error states, date picker accessibility, select dropdown accessibility, textarea (notes field) is labeled

**Locator requirements:**
- Continue using `getByRole()`, `getByLabel()`, and semantic locators
- Avoid CSS selectors unless no accessible alternative exists
- Test keyboard navigation flows (Tab, Enter, Escape where applicable)
- Verify ARIA attributes where present (`aria-current`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`)

**Test organization:**
- Group related tests in describe blocks by feature area
- Keep existing `smoke.spec.ts` and `accessibility.spec.ts` structure
- Add new spec files if needed for feature-specific coverage (e.g., `asset-form.spec.ts`, `asset-list.spec.ts`)

**Run command:** `npm run test:e2e` from repository root

## Secondary Goal: xUnit Backfill for assets-svc

Add comprehensive xUnit test coverage in `services/assets-svc/Tests/` for the assets API:

- **Create:** POST `/api/assets` with valid data, with missing required fields, with invalid data types
- **Read:** GET `/api/assets/:id` for existing asset, for non-existent ID (404), for malformed ID
- **Update:** PUT `/api/assets/:id` with valid changes, with non-existent ID, with partial updates
- **Delete:** DELETE `/api/assets/:id` for existing asset, for non-existent ID (idempotency check)
- **Search:** GET `/api/assets?type=X`, `?status=Y`, `?q=searchterm`, with combined filters, with no matches
- **Stats:** GET `/api/assets/stats/by-status` returns correct counts for seeded data

**Test data strategy:**
- Use in-memory SQLite (`:memory:`) or isolated temporary database per test class
- Seed minimal fixture data in test setup
- Clean up after each test to maintain isolation

**Framework already present:** xUnit, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing

**Run command:** `dotnet test services/assets-svc/Tests/AssetsService.Tests.csproj`

## Secondary Goal: pytest Backfill for reporting-svc

Add pytest coverage in `services/reporting-svc/tests/` for the reporting API and utilities:

- **Warranty reports:** `/reports/warranty-expiring` endpoint returns correct assets within threshold, handles empty results, handles mocked assets-svc errors
- **Utilization reports:** `/reports/utilization` calculates correct assigned vs available ratios, handles edge cases (zero assets, all assigned, all available)
- **CSV import:** `/import/assets` endpoint with valid CSV succeeds, with malformed CSV returns helpful error, with partial failures continues processing valid rows

**Test data strategy:**
- Mock HTTP calls to `assets-svc` and `workforce-svc` using `httpx.AsyncClient` mocking or pytest fixtures
- Do not require live backend services
- Use temporary in-memory structures or isolated test databases if reporting-svc owns any state

**Framework already present:** pytest, pytest-asyncio

**Test-only dependencies you may add:** `pytest-mock`, `respx` (for httpx mocking), or similar - declare in `pyproject.toml` `[project.optional-dependencies] dev`

**Run command:** `pytest services/reporting-svc/tests/` or `python -m pytest services/reporting-svc/tests/`

## Constraints

1. **Do not modify production application code.** Only add test files and test-specific configuration.
2. **Do not add new production dependencies.** Only add test-framework or mocking libraries scoped to dev/test dependencies.
3. **Isolate test data.** Do not depend on shared databases or running services. Use mocks, fakes, or temporary databases.
4. **Mock cross-service HTTP calls.** Reporting service tests should mock calls to assets-svc and workforce-svc.
5. **Document blocking bugs.** If a real production bug prevents a test from passing, document it in the PR description with exact reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior. Mark the test as skipped with a comment referencing the issue number once filed.
6. **Follow Module 2 contribution standards:**
   - Use the repository issue template to open an issue titled "Add test suite backfill"
   - Reference the issue number in the PR
   - Use the PR template
   - Do not commit directly to `main` - open a PR from a feature branch
7. **Include exact commands and results in the PR description:**
   - `npm run test:e2e` output with pass/fail counts
   - `dotnet test` output for assets-svc
   - `pytest` output for reporting-svc
   - Summary of coverage added (e.g., "Added 15 Playwright tests, 12 xUnit tests, 8 pytest tests")

## Success Criteria

- All new tests pass in CI
- No production code modified (only test files added)
- Test runs are isolated and do not require manual setup
- PR follows contribution standards (issue linked, templates used, branch-based workflow)
- PR description includes full test run output and coverage summary

## Notes

- The existing Playwright config at `playwright.config.ts` already starts the full stack via `npm run dev` - reuse this setup
- Assets-svc already has `Tests/AssetsService.Tests.csproj` - add test classes there
- Reporting-svc has an empty `tests/` directory with a README explaining it's intentionally incomplete
- Check `exercises.md` for context on intentional gaps vs bugs - some incomplete validation is by design for course exercises
